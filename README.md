ASP-AJAX-Guestbook
==================

A guestbook based on Classic ASP (VB) and JavaScript/AJAX. Do please note that this script was written back in 2007 and has been uploaded to Github "as is". It's fully working, but I'm sure, in need of some work.

## Installation

1. Download this repo as a .zip
2. Unpack at your localhost / host, runs from both root and subdirectories "out of the box"
3. Either use the AccessDB that comes with the script, or create a MySQL-db for example and update the PATH.
4. All done

### Bugs and issues

As stated above, this script has been uploaded since it might will be usefull for someone still working with Classic ASP 3.0. However developement has been discontinued since 2007 (lol) and I will only respond to security-threat issue reports.

#### Furhter notes

Installation notes and guide in swedish comes in a .txt
